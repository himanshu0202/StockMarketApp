<h2 align="center">About Us</h2>
<p>

Tradein.com is a web application that is designed to simulate buying and selling stocks without the user having to invest real currency. 

A key element to this program will be the ability to register users such that users will have individual portfolios and the users will be able to log into their respective portfolios. After that they will be able to navigate different company profiles to buy and sell stock.
</p>


<p>
A user starts by navigating to the Tradein website. After navigating through the website, the user has the option to log-in with an already registered Username and Password or to register with a new username and password after filling-in some of his details on the provided registration form. The user might also choose to login through his Facebook or Google accounts. Upon registering, the user will be assigned some virtual currency so that he can begin the stock trading process.
</p>
<p>
After the user successfully logs in the user will be directed to their own personal dashboard that will have information that is relevant to them. This information includes the users net worth along with their stock options listed. The dashboard will also have detailed information about each of his stock holdings such as the rate of purchase, the current stock rate, day's loss/gain, total loss/gain. Based on the information in the dashboard, the user who may wish to sell his current holdings may be able to do so by clicking on the sell option which will let him specify the number, name and the trade value of the specific shares that he/she wishes to sell. The user will be displayed the info regarding amount credited to his account and the profit/loss incurred by him as part that transaction. There will be an option to update the user profile, to view and search company profiles.
</p>
<p>
While navigating company profiles, there will be displayed the companies price per share so that the user can see if they are interested in buying. It will also display the days high price and low price, along with a graph displaying the fluctuation of the stock price for the company. Based on the information shown, the user will be able to purchase the stocks for a specific enterprise on the display(current) stock rate by specifying the number of stocks he/she wishes to purchase. The application will display the total quantity deducted from the users account along with the balance remaining in his account for future transactions. The user may also wish to add a company to his watchlist. The watchlist will display a dashboard showing the detailed information about the watchlisted stock such as the stocks day high/day low, percentage change, percentage gain/loss.
